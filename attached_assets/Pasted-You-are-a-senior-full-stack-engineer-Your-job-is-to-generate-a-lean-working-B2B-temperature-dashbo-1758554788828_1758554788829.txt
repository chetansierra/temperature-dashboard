You are a senior full-stack engineer. Your job is to generate a lean, working B2B temperature dashboard application.

## Tech Stack (mandatory)
- Frontend: Next.js 14+ (App Router), npm as the package manager
- State: Zustand for local UI state
- Data fetching: SWR for GET endpoints (revalidate on focus + interval refresh)
- Auth: Supabase Auth (JWT)
- Database: Supabase (Postgres + TimescaleDB)
  - SQL-first migrations (no ORM for v1)
  - Timescale hypertables, compression, continuous aggregates
  - Row-Level Security (RLS) enforced strictly
- APIs: REST endpoints via Next.js Route Handlers (Node runtime only)
- Charts: Recharts for v1, abstracted in <Chart> so ECharts can be swapped in later
- Ingestion: CSV → DB via Python simulator that calls /api/ingest/readings
- Realtime: skipped for v1 (use polling every 30s instead)
- Validation: Zod schemas on all request/response bodies
- Package manager: npm only

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Roles: master, site manager, auditor (time-bound, read-only), admin (read-only superuser)
- Admin: separate login URL (/admin-login), org search, always read-only
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA baseline (keyboard nav, focus states, ARIA/alt text, high contrast mode)
- Error handling: error boundaries per page, log IDs, structured API errors
- Rate limits: 60 GET/min, 20 POST/min, 10 chart queries/min (per user)
- Alerts: in-app notification center + fire-and-forget email
- Data retention: raw 180 days, aggregates forever, 90 days exportable
- Timezones: UTC in DB, display in site-local timezone
- Feature flags: simple env-based booleans
- Sensitive data: mask emails in logs, never log secrets
- Testing: minimal (Zod unit tests, 5–8 API tests with supertest). E2E deferred.
- Backups/seeds: Supabase daily backups; include seed.sql and sample.csv for ingestion simulator

## Deliverables (in strict order)
1. Repository skeleton (file tree) + npm config
   - package.json, tsconfig.json, next.config.mjs, .env.example
   - README with setup instructions
2. Supabase SQL migrations
   - Tables, constraints, indexes, hypertables, aggregates, RLS policies
   - Place in supabase/migrations/
   - Include seed.sql and sample.csv
   - CLI usage: `supabase db reset` (local), `supabase db push` (remote)
3. API endpoints (REST only)
   - /api/health
   - /api/ingest/readings (HMAC headers, idempotency)
   - /api/overview
   - /api/sites, /api/sites/:id
   - /api/environments/:id
   - /api/sensors/:id
   - /api/chart/query (guardrails: ≤25 sensors, ≤30d raw, ≤5000 points, aggregates >7d)
   - /api/alerts, /api/alerts/:id/ack, /api/alerts/:id/resolve
   - /api/settings/*
   - /api/users/invite
4. Pages & routes
   - /overview
   - /sites
   - /sites/[siteId]
   - /environments/[envId]
   - /sensors/[sensorId]
   - /alerts
   - /settings
   - /settings/users
   - /admin-login
5. UI components
   - <Chart type="..."> abstraction
   - KPI tiles
   - Alerts table (filters, role-guarded actions)
   - Chart Builder with server guardrails
   - RoleGuard
   - ErrorBoundary
6. Python simulator
   - Reads CSV, replays to /api/ingest/readings
   - Args: --csv, --speed, --start, --end
   - Mimics real cadence; supports acceleration
7. Tests
   - Zod schema unit tests
   - API tests for auth guard, rate limiting, chart guardrails, alerts actions
8. Runbook
   - Commands for local dev: npm run dev, supabase db reset, simulator usage
   - Commands for deploy: supabase db push, npm run build

## Style & Output Rules
- Keep the repo lean and production-ready
- Only include features marked as v1; skip optional/deferred items
- Always output:
  1) file tree
  2) full file contents (chunked by folder if large)
- For edits: output unified diffs or full file replacements (never partials)
- Use npm (no yarn/pnpm)
- Do not issue client-side DB calls; all DB access is server-side with RLS enforced
- JSON in appendices is normative; if there’s conflict, JSON overrides the human summaries
