# Admin Portal Implementation Tasks

## Overview

Implement complete admin functionality for the Temperature Dashboard with full global access, organization management, and user administration.

## Key Requirements

- **1 Admin globally** (can manage multiple organizations)
- **1 Master User per organization** (organization admin)
- **Admin sets passwords** (users can change later)
- **Admin manages environments & sensors**
- **Organization view switching** (admin can view as master user would)
- **Plan tracking** (show current plan, details added later)

## Priority Order

1. **Phase 1** - Core APIs (foundation)
2. **Phase 2** - Organization Management (core admin function)
3. **Phase 3** - User Management (essential for operations)
4. **Phase 4** - Dashboard & Switching (admin experience)
5. **Phase 5** - Environment/Sensor Management (operational tools)
6. **Phase 6** - Advanced Features (nice-to-have)

**Estimated Timeline: 2-3 weeks for Phases 1-4, additional 1-2 weeks for Phases 5-6**
