## Demo Credentials
The application includes demo credentials displayed on the login page:
- **Master User**: `master@acme.com` / `password123`
- **Site Manager**: `manager.mumbai@acme.com` / `password123`
- **Auditor**: `auditor@temp-audit.com` / `password123`

## Next Steps for Production
1. **Set up Supabase project** and update environment variables
2. **Run database migrations** from the `/supabase` directory
3. **Create demo users** in Supabase Auth dashboard
4. **Configure HMAC secret** for data ingestion
5. **Deploy to production** using the configured autoscale deployment
