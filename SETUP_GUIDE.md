### 1. 📧 Login Credentials Issue - SOLVED!

**The login credentials are now clearly displayed on the login page:**

- **Master User**: `master@acme.com` / `password123`
- **Site Manager**: `manager.mumbai@acme.com` / `password123`
- **Auditor**: `auditor@temp-audit.com` / `password123`
- **Platform Admin**: `admin@dashboard.com` / `password123`

### 2. 🎨 UI Improvements - COMPLETED!

The login page now features:
- ✅ **Professional brand colors** (#10367D, #74B4D9, #EBEBEB)
- ✅ **Modern gradient background**
- ✅ **Clean white card design with shadows**
- ✅ **Improved typography and spacing**
- ✅ **Clear demo credentials display**
- ✅ **Better form styling with focus states**

### 3. 🔧 To Enable Login (Required Setup)

Since you're using placeholder Supabase credentials, you need to either:

#### Option A: Set up Real Supabase (Recommended)
1. Create a Supabase project at https://supabase.com
2. Update `.env.local` with your real credentials:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
   ```
3. Run the database migrations:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   supabase db reset  # This loads the seed data
   ```
4. Create the demo users in Supabase Auth dashboard:
   - Go to Authentication > Users in Supabase dashboard
   - Add each user manually with the emails and passwords shown above

#### Option B: Quick Demo Mode (For Testing UI Only)
The application will show the beautiful new login page even without real Supabase credentials. You can see the improved UI immediately!

### 4. 🧪 Testing the Application

Once Supabase is set up:

1. **Start the dev server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Visit the login page**: http://localhost:3000/login

3. **Try logging in** with any of the demo credentials shown on the page

4. **Explore the dashboard** with different user roles to see role-based access control

### 5. 📱 What You'll See Now
