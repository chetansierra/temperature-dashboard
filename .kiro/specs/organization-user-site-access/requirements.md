# Organization User Site Access - Requirements

## Introduction

This feature defines the access control mechanism that allows any user belonging to an organization to automatically view sites that have been created for their organization by system administrators. This creates a simplified access model where organizational membership determines site visibility, eliminating the need for individual site assignments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an organization user, I want to automatically see all sites created for my organization, so that I can access relevant data without requiring manual site assignments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs into the system THEN the system SHALL identify their organization membership
2. WHEN displaying available sites THEN the system SHALL show all sites associated with the user's organization
3. WHEN an admin creates a new site for an organization THEN all users of that organization SHALL automatically gain access to view that site
4. WHEN a user accesses a site THEN the system SHALL verify the site belongs to their organization before granting access
5. IF a user tries to access a site from a different organization THEN the system SHALL deny access with an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an organization user, I want to view sensor data and environments within my organization's sites, so that I can monitor conditions relevant to my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses an organization site THEN they SHALL be able to view all environments within that site
2. WHEN viewing environments THEN users SHALL have read-only access to sensor data, alerts, and reports
3. WHEN browsing site data THEN the system SHALL display environment information including name, type, and status
4. WHEN accessing sensor readings THEN users SHALL see current and historical data for their organization's sites
5. IF sensor data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate status messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want site access to be automatically managed based on organization membership, so that I don't need to manually assign individual users to sites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates a site for an organization THEN the system SHALL automatically grant access to all current users of that organization
2. WHEN a new user is added to an organization THEN they SHALL automatically gain access to all existing sites for that organization
3. WHEN a user is removed from an organization THEN they SHALL lose access to all sites belonging to that organization
4. WHEN an admin moves a site between organizations THEN user access SHALL update automatically based on the new organization membership
5. IF organization membership changes THEN site access SHALL be updated immediately without requiring system restart

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an organization user, I want clear navigation and filtering of sites, so that I can easily find and access the sites relevant to my organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the sites list THEN the system SHALL only display sites belonging to their organization
2. WHEN navigating between sites THEN users SHALL see clear organization context and site identification
3. WHEN searching for sites THEN the search SHALL be scoped to the user's organization
4. WHEN viewing site details THEN the system SHALL display organization name and site hierarchy information
5. IF no sites exist for the organization THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message indicating no sites are available

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious system, I want to enforce organization-based access controls at the API level, so that data access is properly secured and audited.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate that the requesting user belongs to the organization that owns the requested site
2. WHEN serving site data THEN APIs SHALL filter results to only include sites from the user's organization
3. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and return appropriate HTTP error codes
4. WHEN user sessions are established THEN the system SHALL cache organization membership for efficient access control
5. IF organization membership cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL deny access and require re-authentication

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an organization user, I want consistent access permissions across all interfaces, so that my experience is predictable and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the web interface THEN organization-based site access SHALL be enforced consistently
2. WHEN using mobile applications THEN the same organization access rules SHALL apply
3. WHEN accessing APIs directly THEN organization membership SHALL be validated for all requests
4. WHEN viewing reports and dashboards THEN data SHALL be filtered to show only the user's organization sites
5. IF access rules change THEN all interfaces SHALL reflect the updated permissions immediately
