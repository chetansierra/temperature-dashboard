- Settings (organization configuration)

## Technical Architecture

### Security Model
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Complete data isolation between organizations
- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permissions based on user roles
- **Row-level Security**: Database-level access control ensuring data privacy
- **Authentication**: Secure login with session management
- **API Security**: Bearer token authentication for all API endpoints

### Data Hierarchy
```
Organization (Tenant)
├── Sites (Physical locations)
│   ├── Environments (Temperature-controlled areas)
│   │   ├── Sensors (Temperature monitoring devices)
│   │   └── Readings (Temperature data points)
│   └── Alerts (Temperature threshold violations)
└── Users (Organization members)
```

### Key Capabilities
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live temperature data collection and display
- **Threshold Management**: Configurable temperature limits with automated alerting
